#Creating an Age Distribution of Herion Deaths 
In this project I will explore the age distribution of what age herion users died. I will then observe if there is a difference between age of death in herion users in apose to people who died from other illegal drugs. This code uses a data set that was taken from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?publisher=data.ct.gov&organization=state-of-connecticut . Specifically, the data set looks at the cause of death involving illegal drugs in the state of Conneticut. In order to run this code you will not need to install any certain packages. 

#Running Tests 
1) You will not need to install any special packages 
2) I chose to create a histogram to look at age distribution because it allows me to see the frequency of deaths at each age group.
